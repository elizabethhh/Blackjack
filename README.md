# Blackjack
Blackjack game using Python

Hello! To run this game of Blackjack, simply run the file in the terminal. Here are the rules of the game: try to get as close to 21 as possible. Dealer hits until they get to 17. You can see the dealer's cards except the first one. 

My tests were: if there is an Ace with the cards, if the dealer goes over 17, and if the player goes over 21 to make sure that all the instructions were followed. 

I imported the random library so that cards were shuffled. I also used a dictionary to store values and OOP for class Cards, class Deck, class Hands, class Chips so that you can gamble with the chips.
